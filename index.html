 <h1>Kylie Bailey</h1>
 <h2>Senior in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>

 <p>I am a senior at Bob Jones University studying graphic design. I'm a graphic design intern for Infinity Marketing and I work as a 
  building monitor in the Sargent Art building. I started a floral business with my Mom, so when I'm not doing school work and my internship,
  I'm doing work for our business! I'm looking to get a job as a UX designer in Salt Lake City, UT after I complete school in December.</p>
 <p>
 
 </p>
 <p>
 I enjoy exploring new places, creating art, making flower arrangements, and doing freelance interior design. I spend a lot of time hunkered down in coffee shops
  doing design work!
